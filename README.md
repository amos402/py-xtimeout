## Check function with timeout for tracing or handle it

## Feature
* Check a function call is timeout or not.
* The timeout callback and function call are on the same thread.
* Multi-thread support. Nest call support.

## Usage
```python
def on_timeout(start_time: float):
    """
    :param start_time: 
    """
    traceback.print_stack()
    pdb.set_trace()
    raise Exception("time_out")

# time unit is millisecond
@pymonitor.check_time(10, on_timeout)
def function_1():
    pass

def function_2():
    with pymonitor.check_context(20, on_timeout):
        # do something
        with pymonitor.check_context(10, on_timeout):
            # do something
```

## Implementation Comparison
Here are some comparisons of the other implementations.

* Use `signal` module and emit a signal
    - Only works in main thread.
    - Not good for nest call becauseof one signal correspond one handler.  
      If you need nest support you need to enter the timeout function continually  
      and call `alarm`. The cost depend on your accuracy.
    - Support Linux only.

* Start new thread for work and join it with a time, if it had timeout, handle with it (eg. terminate it)
    - Can't inject the function call. 
    - Overhead from threading.

* Use `sys.settrace` keep tracing for each 
    - A huge cost for that.
